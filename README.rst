WorldMor
=========

**WorldMor** is an application (game) write in Python using framework PyQt.
It is created as a semestral work of **MI-PYT** course at **CTU in Prague**.


Assignment
-----------------

The work aims to create a game that will take place on a 2D endless map. Your aim of the game will be to get the highest score.

The map itself is endless. Visibility is limited. The map finds opponents (TODO: name) controlled by some artificial intelligence (more likely to settle the difficulty). Their goal is your destruction of course, but they have more primitive weapons than you can find.

The score can be obtained for the destruction of computer opponents. Some bonuses can also be placed on the map, where you can get points and weapons which can help you destroy computer opponents.

Weapons will have a different range of damage which they can cause. Also, weapons will have a range. With the use of weapons, it is clear that everyone on the map will have his own life. This can be supplemented by some pharmacies.

With increasing time, the game will become more and more difficult, the number of opponents will increase, and the number of weapons, pharmacies on the map will decreasing.

Specifications:

- Fullscreen mode
- The ability to save and load a saved game
- Increasing skill on an endless map
- Several levels of enemy intelligence
- Some different types of weapons
