        <b>WorldMor</b> is an application (game) write in Python using Python binding of 
        the cross-platform GUI toolkit Qt.
        It is created as a semestral work of <b>MI-PYT</b> course at <b>CTU in Prague</b>.
        <br>
        The principle of the game is to achieve the highest possible score 
        (they are gained for the elimination of opponents). 
        The difficulty of the game increases over time. 
        There are weapons and objects on the map that can be used, 
        but they can also be used by opponents. <b>So survive how long you can!!</b>
